Data and code for Iu Mien tone variation and change

Linguistic data and code used to investigate how tone contours have changed over time in the Iu Mien language as spoken in northern Thailand

The current project consists of an acoustic analysis of the tones of Iu Mien from recordings obtained in 2022. The raw data and the R code is used to process and analyze the data is deposited here. The dataset and code are part of a research project entitled "Iu Mien tone change in real time: A restudy of L-Thongkum (1988)"

Abstract:
This study investigates tone changes in Iu Mien, a Hmong-Mien language with two complex contour tones: high rising-falling (T3) and low rising-falling (T4). L-Thongkum (1988) observed younger speakers producing rising variants of T3 and T4, which she attributed to Thai contact. This study replicates L-Thongkumâ€™s study 34 years later to observe tone changes in real time and examine the potential role of peak delay, a phonetic bias resulting in a later f0 peak. 40 speakers (ages 12-84) produced T3 and T4 monosyllables in isolation and in a carrier phrase. f0 was modeled using Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling (GAMM). Results confirm incremental change toward rising variants of T3 and T4. Older speakers showed peak delay (with a rising contour) under conditions of shorter duration and following a low tone. Critically, younger speakers produced peak-delayed variants more generally, indicating generalization of the rising contour. While language contact may have initiated the changes, a phonetic bias toward peak delay generated the seeds of potential change. The change from rising-falling > rising aligns with apparent-time studies in other Asian languages, suggesting this may be a crosslinguistically unidirectional pathway.
